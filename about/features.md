### **What can I do with Blockscout?**

* **Deep Search**: Find all the information you need on Blocks, Transactions, Tags and more through the integrated search box.
* **Interact with Contracts**: Read and write to contracts directly from the Blockscout UI.
* **Verify Contracts:**  Use [Hardhat](../for-users/smart-contract-interaction/verifying-a-smart-contract/hardhat-verification-plugin.md), [Sourcify](../for-users/smart-contract-interaction/verifying-a-smart-contract/contracts-verification-via-sourcify.md), and other tools to quickly verify  contracts.
* **Make API calls**: Make requests to a [robust API](../for-users/api/) using standard and customized endpoints.
