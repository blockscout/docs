BlockScout offered prior support for the Ethereum mainnet. This instance was discontinued; however a new instance is now planned to further increase explorer diversity on Ethereum and provide additional transparency for Ethereum users.

### ✅ ERC721 Metadata

**Target Date:** Q4 2019 

**Status:** ✅ Complete, ERC721 Metadata storage and display ([Release 2.1.0](https://forum.poa.network/t/blockscout-2-1-0-release/3128)) and verification checks ([Release 2.1.1](https://forum.poa.network/t/blockscout-2-1-1-release/3172)) are implemented.

[ERC-721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) non-fungible tokens represent ownership of digital or physical assets. Each token is unique, and may include images and other data which identifies the asset and provides additional information. This might include registration information (for example land, property or art registration), identifying numbers or other data unique to that token. As ERC-721 tokens continue to proliferate, it is important to display the relevant information related to each owned token.

### ✅ Staking DApp Integration

**Target Date:** Q3 2020 

**Status:** ✅ Complete Q4 2020

BlockScout will support the new POSDAO staking consensus mechanism through an on-board UI. The initial implementation will support the [xDai Stable Chain](https://xdaichain.com). This will allow users to place stake directly from the interface, monitor validator activity, and participate in consensus on the xDai Chain.

### ✅ Smart Contract Write Functionality

**Target Date:** Q2 - Q3 2020 

**Status**: ✅ Complete, Write contract/ write proxy functionalities are implemented ([Release 3.3.0](https://forum.poa.network/t/blockscout-v3-3-0-beta/3558)).

Users can currently verify and read contracts on BlockScout. The next smart contract development phase will allow users to interact with contracts directly through the interface. Verified contract methods will be accessible and users can connect through a web3 wallet (such as MetaMask) to access and execute contract functions.

### ✅ ERC1155 Support

**Target Date:** Q2 2021 

**Status**: ✅ Basic Functionality added for xDai chain, additional support in process.

ERC-1155 tokens are increasing in popularity as a way to manage multiple-token types including fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single instance. This feature provides parsing and display of tokens contained within an ERC-1155. Additional functionality such as metadata display is in process.

### ✅ Rollup Support

**Target Date:** Q4 2021 

**Status**: ✅ Instances for Optimism and Arbitrum on Gnosis Chain

BlockScout availability and support is available for Optimism and Arbitrum on the Gnosis Chain. Includes tracking for gas price on L1 and the L2 implementations. Currently Optimism is the favored deployment.

* Optimism: [https://blockscout.com/xdai/optimism](https://blockscout.com/xdai/optimism)

* Arbitrum: [https://blockscout.com/xdai/aox/](https://blockscout.com/xdai/aox/)

### ✅ EIP-1559 Support

**Target Date:** Q3-Q4 2021 

**Status**: ✅ Complete

The Gnosis Chain explorer supports EIP-1559 functionality with a stated transaction type (2 for EIP-1559) and includes data reporting of Max Fee per Gas, Max Priority Fee per Gas and Priority Fee / Tip paid for a transaction.
