title: "L2 Funding Proposal"
description: Proposal for funding to enhance Blockscout for next-generation L2 explorers, including new features, UI, and developer experience.

---

Blockscout is a leading open-source blockchain explorer supporting over 100 EVM-based chains, including L1s, testnets, and a growing number of L2s. As the ecosystem evolves, L2 projects require advanced features for batch data, L1↔L2 transparency, and custom rollup support. To meet these needs and reach feature parity with closed-source explorers, Blockscout seeks additional grant funding.

## Why Support Blockscout for L2s?
- **Open-source and transparent:** Blockscout is fully open-source, enabling community-driven innovation and transparency.
- **Proven adoption:** Used by Optimism, Arbitrum Nova, Metis, Boba, and many more.
- **Ecosystem growth:** Funding will accelerate development of L2-specific features and UI improvements, benefiting the entire EVM ecosystem.

## Key Needs for L2 Support
### Enhanced L2 Data Views
- Prioritize batch data (Index, L1 Timestamp, Size, L1 tx hash, L1 block number, Batch root)
- Clear L1↔L2 transaction mapping and fraud proof window visibility
- Easy contract verification for rollup/system contracts
- Customizable views for different L2 architectures

### UI & User Experience Upgrades
- Modern, intuitive interface with advanced features
- My Account section with tagging, custom ABIs, and app integrations
- App marketplace and improved onboarding

### Developer Experience Improvements
- Comprehensive documentation and usage examples
- Streamlined deployment and configuration
- Migration of microservices to Rust for performance and maintainability
- Analytics and transparency for L2 transactions and contracts

## Get Involved
Blockscout is already collaborating with leading L2s (Optimism, zkEVM, zkSync) to gather requirements and build the next generation of explorers. Additional funding will accelerate this work and deliver a best-in-class, open-source solution for the entire ecosystem.
