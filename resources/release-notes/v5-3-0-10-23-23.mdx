<Info>
All backend release notes are now available on github at [https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout/releases](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout/releases)

</Info>

## Highlights

* `CHAIN_TYPE` env variable which can provide different logic for fetchers, API, views, DB schema extensions are applied to the explorer. Additional values will be supported in upcoming releases - currently supported values are:

  * `ethereum` - default value

  * `polygon_edge` - chains based on Polygon Edge nodes

  * `rsk` - for Rootstock (rskj node)

* TVL display is live with the DefiLlama API integration

* DB schema update which will support additional NFT views on owner addresses. The view is still in development, scheme update was required first.

* `IPFS_GATEWAY_URL` endpoint allows projects to connect Blockscout to their own IPFS gateway for fetching token metadata.

* Many additional improvements and fixes on the indexer side and API.
