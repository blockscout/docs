# v5.2.0: 6/20/23

## Highlights

This update focused on optimizations related to search speed and overall explorer performance. Transactions are now populating much faster on the page and the UX is improved to provide relevant search details quickly.

There was also a focus on supporting zkEVM and Polygon Edge networks, providing needed support for Polygon associated chains.

CSV exports were also improved with filters, making export data more usable for a variety of applications.
