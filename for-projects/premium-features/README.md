:bullettrain\_side: [**Hosting on blockscout.com**](your-chain-on-blockscout.com.md): Self-hosting can be difficult, often requiring a dev-ops team to make critical in-house updates and/or customizations. A Blockscout-hosted chain not only gives projects access to expert, dedicated technical support, it also greatly increases project visibility.

:lizard: [**Custom Themes:**](custom-branded-themes.md) Custom themes help create a seamless blockchain experience for users.  A consistent look and feel helps orient the user, and custom elements like links to various related elements (NFTs, website links etc) can increase engagement and trust with your application across platforms.

This includes community requested features, UI enhancements, protocol updates, fixes, and any other additions.

:person\_juggling: **ERC-1155 Support:**  [ERC-1155s](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) are increasingly popular for batching and flexible multi-token interactions.
