title: "Sourcify Verification"
---

Along with contract verification through a flattened source file (the default option in Blockscout), a [Sourcify](https://sourcify.dev/) verification option through their UI is also available.

## Usage Example

Verify your contract using Sourcify:

1\) Go to the Verify contract page *(Other -> Verify contract)*

<Frame caption="Go to Other -> Verify contract">

</Frame>

2\) Enter the deployed contract address, select Sourcify (Solidity or Vyper) from the Verification method dropdown.

</Frame>

3\) Now follow the instructions inside the Sourcify widget. Select the smart contract language of the source code and a verification method.

</Frame>

4\) Upload or paste your contract source code according to the selected verification method. In the example, we paste the contract sources as Std Json into the text box. Select the compiler version and contract identifier.

Once all information is provided, start the verification by clicking the Verify Contract button.

</Frame>

5\) You can follow the verification process by clicking on the View Job Status button.

After several seconds your contract should be verified through Sourcify's API (If verification fails, you will see the reason in the job status page). Verification metadata will be saved in the Blockscout DB and you will see the verified contract page with the link to the same metadata in the [Sourcify contract repository](https://repo.sourcify.dev/).

### Example Contract:

* Contract [verified in Blockscout](https://gnosis.blockscout.com/address/0x4f15a6e74CFC2F80D5967a8aB75F3c83D8043cF4?tab=contract)

* The same contract in the [Sourcify contract repository](https://repo.sourcify.dev/contracts/full_match/100/0x4f15a6e74CFC2F80D5967a8aB75F3c83D8043cF4/).
