title: "OpenZeppelin Contract Verification"
description: Instructions for various development environments
---

<Info>
Page partially based on [OpenZeppelin Tutorial](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-verify-with-hardhat-or-truffle-a-smart-contract-using-openzeppelin-contracts/4119).

</Info>

Due to compiler constraints, contracts which include OpenZeppelin-related source contracts (e.g., `import@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol;`) can cause problems with verification. The sources must be provided explicitly during the contract verification process.

Below we describe verification information when including these contracts specific to different development environments.

* [Hardhat](/devs/verification/openzeppelin-contract-verification#hardhat)

* [Foundry (forge)](/devs/verification/openzeppelin-contract-verification#foundry-forge)

* [Remix](/devs/verification/openzeppelin-contract-verification#remix)

## Hardhat

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is a full-featured development environment for contract compilation, deployment, and verification. The [Hardhat Verification plugin](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify) supports contract verification on Blockscout and includes in-built functionality to address verification with OpenZeppelin-based imports.

A separate tutorial about contract verification via Hardhat on Blockscout [is available here](/devs/verification/hardhat-verification-plugin).

## Foundry (forge)

[Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/) is a smart contract development toolchain. Foundry manages your dependencies, compiles your project, runs tests, deploys, and lets you interact with the chain from the command line and via Solidity scripts.

Forge is a command-line tool that ships with Foundry. Forge tests, builds, and deploys your smart contracts. Forge supports contract verification out of the box ([https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-verify-contract](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-verify-contract))

A separate tutorial about contract verification via Foundry on Blockscout [is available here](/devs/verification/foundry-verification).

## Remix

While there are 2 plugins available to help with this process, Etherscan and Flattener. Currently only Flattener works with Blockscout. You can use this plugin to flatten contracts and submit for verification as flattened source code. This is the recommended option.

We also include the Manual Standard Input JSON Method below the flattener instructions. This method is not recommended, but included since it is also a viable method.

### Flattener Plugin

1. Go to Plugin Manager and search for "flattener". Activate the plugin.

    </Frame>

2. The plugin is now available in the lefthand menu.

    </Frame>

3. Compile the contract you want to verify.

     <img src="/images/9ec5cf11-image.jpeg" />
    </Frame>

4. Return to the Flattener. The ‘Flatten contract\_name’ button should appear. Click the button. Flattened source code is copied onto the clipboard.

    </Frame>

5. Go to Blockscout and on the verification page choose the ‘*Via flattened source code*’ method. 
    <Frame caption="">
     <img src="/images/cfa02a2d-image.jpeg" />
    </Frame>

6. Paste the copied flattened source code into the ‘*Enter the Solidity Contract Code*’ field. 
    <Frame caption="">
     <img src="/images/0e37fe43-image.jpeg" />
    </Frame>

7. Check that all info is correct and click the Verify and Publish button to verify your contract. Once verified, the code tab will include the ✅ icon and source code will be viewable.

### Manual Standard Input Json with Remix

Standard input json is basically the raw file fed into the Solidity compiler on verification. There are some minor updates made regarding info the output compiler should return, but the main contract-related fields remain the same. This way, standard json allows you to specify the most subtle compiler settings, as well as to specify all source files.

It is quite cumbersome and tedious work, so it is preferable to use any of the above methods, however, we describe the process in more detail for those who want to use it.

For this tutorial, we will create standard json for the following contract:

```typescript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract OpenZeppelinSample is Ownable {
    uint256 public a;

    constructor(uint256 _a) {
        a = _a;
    }

    function set(uint256 _a) public {
        a = _a;
    }
}
```

1\) Start by creating a template which will be filled with sources later. For this purpose, we will use a metadata file generated by the compiler. You can find it in the “Compilation Details” tab (ensure that correct contract is chosen).

2\) The only fields required for standard json input are “language”, “settings”, and “sources”. In addition, only content is needed for sources. Add it for each source and remove everything unnecessary.

```json
{
    "language": "Solidity",
    "settings": {
        "compilationTarget": {
            "contracts/OpenZeppelinSample.sol": "OpenZeppelinSample"
        },
        "evmVersion": "london",
        "libraries": {},
        "metadata": {
            "bytecodeHash": "ipfs"
        },
        "optimizer": {
            "enabled": false,
            "runs": 200
        },
        "remappings": []
    },
    "sources": {
        "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol": {
            "content": ""
        },
        "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol": {
            "content": ""
        },
        "contracts/OpenZeppelinSample.sol": {
            "content": ""
        }
    }
}
```

*Note that the only fields to fill in the contents for each source file. Everything else (including compiler settings) is already filled via the metadata file.*

3\) First, add the content for the main `OpenZeppelinSample.sol` file

```swift
{
    "language": "Solidity",
    "settings": {
        "compilationTarget": {
            "contracts/OpenZeppelinSample.sol": "OpenZeppelinSample"
        },
        "evmVersion": "london",
        "libraries": {},
        "metadata": {
            "bytecodeHash": "ipfs"
        },
        "optimizer": {
            "enabled": false,
            "runs": 200
        },
        "remappings": []
    },
    "sources": {
        "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol": {
            "content": ""
        },
        "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol": {
            "content": ""
        },
        "contracts/OpenZeppelinSample.sol": {
            "content": "// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\n\npragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;\n\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\";\n\ncontract OpenZeppelinSample is Ownable {\n    uint256 public a;\n\n    constructor(uint256 _a) {\n        a = _a;\n    }\n\n    function set(uint256 _a) public {\n        a = _a;\n    }\n}"
        }
    }
}
```

4\) Next, add the sources for @openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol contract that is being imported. They can be found inside the `.deps/npm/` directories, which will appear after contract compilation.

5\) The last source is a "`../utils/Context.sol`" imported from `@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol`. You can find it in the same `.deps/npm` directory.
