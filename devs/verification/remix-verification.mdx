title: "Remix Verification"
---

Since [v0.56.0](https://github.com/remix-project-org/remix-project/releases/tag/v0.56.0) Remix IDE comes with a built-in verification plugin that allows you to verify your contracts on multiple verifiers. 

To verify your contracts on Remix:
- Turn on the plugin "CONTRACT VERIFICATION" from the plugin manager.
- On the File Explorer, select and compile the contract you want to verify.
- On the Contract Verification plugin, select the Contract Name, Chain, and input the contract address. Add constructor arguments if needed.
- Click "Verify". You can see the process on the "Receipts" tab.

You can find more information about the plugin in the [Remix documentation](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contract_verification.html#verify-page).
