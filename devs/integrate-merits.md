# Integrate Merits

### What are Blockscout Merits?

Merits are digital rewards collected by interacting with Blockscout and Blockscout-related apps and by participating in various activities (like contests, X participation, telegram participation, app participation and more).  Merits are chain agnostic and can be incorporated into any application. For more details see the [Merits section of the docs](../using-blockscout/merits/).

### Using Merits as an activity incentive

Merits are used to incentivize different activities within the Blockscout universe. For example:

* **Blockscout explorer basics:** You earn Merits by signing up for the program. Once you are signed up, you can earn additional Merits by completing a daily claim. You can also share your referral code and earn Merits when new users sign up with that code.&#x20;
* **Blockscout activity pass:** The activity pass allows you to earn Merits for additional Blockscout activities like verifying and interacting with contracts.
* **Telegram mini app.** The telegram Blockscout Merits Bot allows for direct communication with subscribers. Users who download the bot receive extra Merits -> [https://t.me/blockscout\_merits\_bot](https://t.me/blockscout_merits_bot)
* **Swapscout swapping app**. Merits are incorporated in the app so that users can view their balance and earn Merits for their swaps. [https://swap.blockscout.com/](https://swap.blockscout.com/)
* **Blockscout campaigns**. Participants in time-gated campaigns such as rating Dapps or Twitter(X) contests receive additional Merits.
* **Partner campaigns**. Merits are allocated to users of other protocols as an additional incentive for use.

### Integrating Merits into your application

Merits can be integrated in different ways into your application.  Ideas may be to include Merits as a reward for user interactions with your app or a general reward for any activity.  Merits can be distributed to users via the API.

Users can have the ability to sign up for Merits through your app and/or login to their Merits account. You can also display individual Merits balances and leaderboard balances within your application.&#x20;

You can retrieve basic data without an API key, but for interactivity purposes you will need to request one via our Discord channel.&#x20;

### Distribute Merits
