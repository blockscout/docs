{% endhint %}

### Set ENV Variables with CLI

Use the export command to set variables. For example:

```bash
$ export ETHEREUM_JSONRPC_VARIANT=nethermind
$ export COIN=POA
$ export NETWORK=POA
```

### Example ENV Variables Set

The following variables are set for the [Gnosis Chain Blockscout Instance](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/). _Note that some variables are not included as they contain private information which should not be exposed._
