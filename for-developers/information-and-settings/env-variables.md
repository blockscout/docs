# ENV Variables

{% hint style="warning" %}
The following are backend related variables. [Frontend common ENVs for the new frontend are available here](../frontend-migration/frontend-common-envs.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Additional information related to certain variables is available on the [ansible deployment ](../ansible-deployment/variables.md)page.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You will find deprecated ENV vars on the [Deprecated ENV Variables](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-developers/information-and-settings/deprecated-env-variables) page.
{% endhint %}

### Set ENV Variables with CLI

Use the export command to set variables. For example:

```bash
$ export ETHEREUM_JSONRPC_VARIANT=nethermind
$ export COIN=POA
$ export NETWORK=POA
```

### Example ENV Variables Set

The following variables are set for the [Gnosis Chain Blockscout Instance](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/). _Note that some variables are not included as they contain private information which should not be exposed._

### Time format

Can be set in format `1h` for 1 hour, `1m` for 1 minute, `1s` or `1` for 1 second, `1ms` for 1 millisecond

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Note_: Before release 5.1.2, all environment variables of time format supported only integers in seconds (without dimensions) as values.
