Blocks update on the homepage as they are created with basic information including block number (block height), number of transactions in the block, and time since the block was created.

Click on a specific block number for information about that block, or **View All Blocks** for a more detailed overview of recent blocks.

The all blocks page can also be accessed from the top menu.

<Info>
Blockscout displays are configurable and may show different information depending on the instance and/or consensus method. These examples use a V1 instance of the UI. **V2 views are in process.**

#### Details by line

1. Number of transactions in the block / size of block in bytes / time since block was created.

2. Validator appending the block to the chain (fee recipient).

3. Reward to validator (in ETH). Equals the amount of priority fees sent by users to include transactions in the block.

4. Same as (3).

5. Portion of tx fee (in ETH) burned due to EIP-1559. Amount burned = `baseFeePerGas * gasUsed`

6. Block Gas limit. On Ethereum this is 30M gas: 2x the target size of 15M.

7. Amount of gas used in the block (amount and % of block space used). The blue line visualizes the %.

## Individual Block Page
