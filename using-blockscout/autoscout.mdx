### Get Started with Autoscout

1. **Create an account:** To get started, go to [https://deploy.blockscout.com/](https://deploy.blockscout.com/), create an account, and login to get started.

2. **Purchase credits:** You will need credits to launch your explorer. Each credit costs \$1.00. Purchase via Stripe with a credit card; a crypto option is coming soon. Credits are deducted in real time, see the pricing table below for costs.

      **You can start with any amount of credits to test your instance. Instances cost between 0.35 - 1.35 credits per hour, depending on the size.**

      a. If you are testing the service, request test credits in the [Blockscout Discord](https://discord.gg/blockscout) `#autoscout` channel. Share your email and request and we will top off your account for testing.

3. **Add a new instance:** Click the Add instance button to get started.

4. **Add your network info**: See below for info on configuration and parameters.

5. **Deploy your explorer:** Click save and deploy to start the deployment process. In 5-10 minutes your explorer will be live and indexing your chain. Once deployed you can access your explorer link.

## Autoscout Pricing

Autoscout is a pay-as-you-go service. **Start with any amount of credits** and **increase the balance at any time**.

If your account runs out of credits your instance will be stopped until you top your account back up. If this happens, you will need to relaunch (and reindex) your instance once you add additional credits. Instances will scale based on daily transactions, so be sure to monitor and top up accordingly.

## Create Instance

There are several tabs to fill out to launch your instance; Info, Branding, and Rollup config (if needed). Plugins (currently the only live plugin is stats) can be added once your instance is fully indexed.

You can edit parameters at any time, but this typically requires relaunching and reindexing the instance.

### Info

</Frame>

The following parameters are in the Info section. \* parameters are required.

* **Instance size\***: Select based on the number of transactions anticipated for the instance. The costs are currently placeholders, but your credits will be impacted according to chain usage.

* **Chain name**: The chain name will be shown in the top explorer banner.

* **Instance name\***: A label for your instance, it is reflected in the url of the instance ie https\://instance-name.cloud.blockscout.com/

* **Chain ID**: If you don't know the chain ID you can get with the `eth_chainId` JSON-RPC method.

* **Node type:** Choose from the list of clients for the archive node:

  * Besu, Erigon, Anvil, Geth, Parity

* **Gas token symbol**: Will show in the interface, for example ETH if your chain uses Ether for gas.

* **Mainnet or Testnet**: Select the type of chain, if Testnet a label will be added to the instance.

* **This chain is a Rollup**: If selected, another field will appear to select **Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon zkEVM or zkSync**. You will then fill out additional information in the Rollup Config tab.

* **HTTP RPC URL\***: The **archive node** url (https\://your-rpc-url) *Note: archive node is required for internal transactions and token/coin historical balances. *[*Tracing should be enabled*](/setup/requirements/node-tracing-json-rpc-requirements)* for internal transactions.*

* **WS URL**: The websocket url (wss\://ws.your-websocket-url)

* **Chain spec URL**: URL to chain specification path json (Sepolia example: [chainspec.json](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-genesis-generator/blob/master/apps/el-gen/sepolia/chainspec.json) or [genesis.json](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-genesis-generator/blob/master/apps/el-gen/sepolia/genesis.json)). You will use the raw JSON file; in the Sepolia example this url is [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-genesis-generator/master/apps/el-gen/sepolia/chainspec.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-genesis-generator/master/apps/el-gen/sepolia/chainspec.json)

* **Custom Domain**: You can use a custom domain for your instance but must configure your DNS and add a DNS `CNAME` record pointing to `autoscout.cname.blockscout.com`

* **Public RPC URL**: Enables 'add to MetaMask button'. Can be the same as the RPC URL if this is a public node.

* **WalletConnect project ID:** Enables the ability for Read and Write functionality with smart contracts. [Learn more about setting one up here](/setup/configuration-options/walletconnect-project-id-for-contract-read-write).

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why can't I see internal transactions?">
There could be several reasons for this. Your RPC may not be an archive node and [tracing](/setup/requirements/node-tracing-json-rpc-requirements) may not be turned on for that node. Once you switch to an RPC with tracing enabled internal transactions will still not be indexed until you spin up a new instance. In this case you will need to shut down your instance and create a new one.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is there an Autoscout API?">
Yes, there is but it requires an API key to use. It can be useful if you are spinning up many instances or need to check on many instances at the same time. Contact us in Discord #autoscout channel to request an API key. See the API Swagger Docs for more info: [https://blockscout.github.io/swaggers/services/autoscout/main/index.html](https://blockscout.github.io/swaggers/services/autoscout/main/index.html)
