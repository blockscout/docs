description: Request a tag or report an incorrect tag

Request a public tag for your project's contracts on the public Blockscout instance. Tags appear in search, help create brand awareness for projects, and make exploration easier.

Once submitted, tags are reviewed and accepted/denied manually by the instance admin. If accepted, the tag is added to the public instance. It is also possible to report incorrect public tags through the public tags section.
