Export to CSV gives users a way to easily download and analyze blockchain data. It is available for tabs on the address page including transactions, internal transactions, tokens, and logs.

<Info>
Note: simplified CSV exports (transactions and transfers only, with no ability to define time periods) exist in Blockscout releases up to 3.5.1. Enhanced CSV export is available from v3.5.2+
