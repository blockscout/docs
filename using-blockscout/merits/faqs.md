<summary>What chains are Merits available on?</summary>

Merits will be rolled out to many Blockscout supported chains in the future. Right now they are available on:

* [Ethereum Mainnet](https://eth.blockscout.com/)
* [Ethereum Sepolia](https://eth-sepolia.blockscout.com/)
* [Ethereum Holesky](https://eth-holesky.blockscout.com/)

Your Merits account is chain agnostic - you can claim Merits and collect referral bonuses on any supported chain.&#x20;

<summary>How does the daily claim work?</summary>

The daily claim is worth 10 Merits. You can claim one time per day, and the amount resets to 10 Merits at 0:00 UTC each day. To claim, login to the Dashboard and click the claim button.&#x20;

</details>

<summary>How do I refer someone to the program?</summary>

In your Merits dashboard you will find a referral code and a referral link you can share with your friends. They can follow the link directly or enter the code when signing up to the program for the first time.

<summary>How do I receive referral rewards?</summary>

You do not receive referral rewards when someone first signs up using your referral code or claims their daily bonus.&#x20;

However, you will receive rewards (10% of the Merits they earn) for block explorer usage or activities/campaigns they complete. These rewards will accumulate to your account, and you can claim to your account with the claim button in the dashboard. &#x20;

Activities which earn referral rewards are still in development, and will be listed once they become available.&#x20;

<summary>Where can I use my Merits?</summary>

Merits are collectible rewards displayed in your Blockscout dashboard. They show your Blockscout adoption, usage, and mastery and promote learning in a gamified way.   Right now you don't use them other than to show off your block explorer skills. In the future Merits may unlock access to new features, merchandise, discounts, and other exclusive opportunities and benefits.

<summary>Can I earn Merits using <a href="https://swap.blockscout.com/">Swapscout</a>?</summary>

Yes you can! Swapscout users who are signed up to the Merits program receive Merits based on their own usage, total usage (how many users use [Swapscout](https://swap.blockscout.com/)) and fees. These Merits are automatically distributed to the account each day at 0:00 UTC. See the [Earn Merits when using Swapscout ](../swapscout/earn-merits-when-using-swapscout.md)page for more information on this distribution.
