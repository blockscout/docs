<summary>What is Performance Rank?</summary>

Performance Rank is your position among all users with Activity Passes who are earning Merits. A higher rank means you are among the top users who have earned the most Merits. The higher your Performance Rank, the more Merits you receive.

<summary>How does Performance Rank influence the Merits I receive?  </summary>

Different Performance Ranks result in  different amounts of Merits received on a weekly basis. For example, users in the top 10% (≥ 90% ) receive 100 extra Merits per week.

• **≥ 90%** — **100 Merits**

• **≥ 75%** — **80 Merits**

• **≥ 50%** — **60 Merits**

• **≥ 25%** — **40 Merits**

• **≥ 5%** — **20 Merits**

• **< 5%** — **5 Merits**

_**Note:** The Merits distribution per Performance Rank may change based on program participation, please stay tuned!_
