### How it works

Get an Activity Pass, then regular Blockscout usage earns your extra Merits.

1. Activity passes become available periodically on the [Merits hub](https://merits.blockscout.com/). They are available in the **Spend Merits** tab.
2. Purchase a pass using your Merits.
3. Login to Blockscout with your Merits wallet.
4. Complete various actions on Blockscout. Your Merits will increase weekly based on your activity and other user's activity.

Bonus: Activity Pass holders can mint an exclusive NFT on the [Blockscout Badges site](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MjSwkv4zokqCUebt-98/).

### Activity Pass Actions

The following actions will earn you additional Merits when you have an Activity Pass. You need to be **logged into Blockscout with your Merits address** and **hold an Activity Pass on that address** to qualify.

1. Regular Blockscout usage. Checking addresses, balances, tokens, etc. All the things you normally do on Blockscout earn you more Merits.
2. Using Blockscout-related apps like [Swapscout ](../swapscout/)and [Revokescout](../revokescout.md).
3. Verifying contracts through the Blockscout UI. [This guide](https://www.blog.blockscout.com/how-to-verify-your-smart-contract-with-the-blockscout-ui/) shows a simple example using hardhat.
4. Interacting with contracts on the Blockscout UI. [Use Read and Write methods directly from Blockscout](https://docs.blockscout.com/devs/verification/interacting-with-smart-contracts) to interact with contracts.
