### Merits

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Where can I learn more about the Merits program?">
The blog announcement includes information about the origins of the program, how you can earn Merits, and future directions. [Merits announcement blog post](https://blog.blockscout.com/blockscout-merits-rewarding-block-explorer-skills).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What chains are Merits available on?">
Merits will be rolled out to many Blockscout supported chains in the future. Right now they are available on:

* [Ethereum Mainnet](https://eth.blockscout.com/)

* [Ethereum Sepolia](https://eth-sepolia.blockscout.com/)

* [Ethereum Holesky](https://eth-holesky.blockscout.com/)

Your Merits account is chain agnostic - you can claim Merits and collect referral bonuses on any supported chain.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does the daily claim work?">
The daily claim is worth 10 Merits. You can claim one time per day, and the amount resets to 10 Merits at 0:00 UTC each day. To claim, login to the Dashboard and click the claim button.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I refer someone to the program?">
In your Merits dashboard you will find a referral code and a referral link you can share with your friends. They can follow the link directly or enter the code when signing up to the program for the first time.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I receive referral rewards?">
You do not receive referral rewards when someone first signs up using your referral code or claims their daily bonus.

However, you will receive rewards (10% of the Merits they earn) for block explorer usage or activities/campaigns they complete. These rewards will accumulate to your account, and you can claim to your account with the claim button in the dashboard.

Activities which earn referral rewards are still in development, and will be listed once they become available.

Learn more in the [Merits announcement blog post](https://blog.blockscout.com/blockscout-merits-rewarding-block-explorer-skills).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where can I use my Merits?">
Merits are collectible rewards displayed in your Blockscout dashboard. They show your Blockscout adoption, usage, and mastery and promote learning in a gamified way. Right now you don't use them other than to show off your block explorer skills. In the future Merits may unlock access to new features, merchandise, discounts, and other exclusive opportunities and benefits.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I earn Merits using Swapscout">
Yes you can! Swapscout users who are signed up to the Merits program receive Merits based on their own usage, total usage (how many users use [Swapscout](https://swap.blockscout.com/)) and fees. These Merits are automatically distributed to the account each day at 0:00 UTC. See the [Earn Merits when using Swapscout](/using-blockscout/swapscout/earn-merits-when-using-swapscout)page for more information on this distribution.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do streaks work?">
Streaks are achieved by claiming Merits on consecutive days within a 24 hour span. You can earn additional Merits for longer streaks. Check the [streak rewards](/using-blockscout/merits/streak-rewards) page for more details.

### Badges

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What are Badges?">
Blockscout Badges is a new initiative by the Blockscout Team, designed to celebrate and recognize our community members for their involvement in key campaigns and contributions.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are there different traits in each collection?">
Most Blockscout Badge collections features four distinct rarity levels, giving users an exciting opportunity to mint a legendary NFT. The rarity tiers include Common, Rare, Super Rare, and Legendary, with each mint offering a randomized chance at unlocking the most coveted level.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does the minting process work?">
Minting a Blockscout NFT is quick and simple. Just connect your preferred wallet and switch to the Base network. Select the NFT collection, and if you are eligible to mint you will be able to click on the ‘Mint’ button. Use the same wallet address you used in the relevant campaign, as your eligibility is tied to that specific address. Once minted, you can view and verify your new Blockscout NFT on the Blockscout Explorer by searching your wallet address and exploring the tokens stored in your wallet

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why am I ineligible?">
Participants for each NFT were gathered during the designated campaign period. But don’t worry—Blockscout will be launching more NFTs in future campaigns! Be sure to follow our social channels to stay updated on the next exciting opportunity

<Accordion title="Can I transfer or sell badges?">
Yes! All Blockscout Badges are transferable, allowing you to move them to new wallets or sell them on secondary markets

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are collections limited in quantity?">
Most collections are limited, with a maximum of one NFT per participant per campaign.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What else can I do with a badge?">
For now your badge is an NFT that proves you completed a certain Blockscout related activity. Show it off with pride! There may be future applications for Blockscout badges like access to events, badge-limited swag or other goodies. Stay tuned for more details.
