Earn additional Merits by visiting and claiming once per day. A day starts at 00:00 UTC and ends at 23:59 UTC.

<Info>
To maintain a streak, you must make a claim each calendar day. The timing on the claim doesn't matter, it can occur any time between 00:00 UTC and 23:59 UTC.

</Info>

* Merits must be claimed once per day to maintain a streak. Every day you make a Merits claim, your streak increases by 1.

* If you fail to make a claim on a calendar day, your streak resets to 0.

* Every 7 days of a streak results in an increased Merit reward. This is a single day award which can is claimed each 7th day of your streak (7,14,21,28 etc).

* Currently, the highest reward is 20 Merits, for a total of 30 Merits (10 daily claim Merits + 20 streak reward Merits) available to claim on streak reward days.
