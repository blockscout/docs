### What are Blockscout Badges?

Blockscout Badges are digital rewards (NFTs) that you can earn by participating in Blockscout community activities and campaigns.

### What makes each badge special?

Each badge collection has four rarity levels:

* Common

* Rare

* Super Rare

* Legendary

When you mint a badge, you'll randomly receive one of these rarity levels – like opening a mystery box!

### How do I get a badge?

1. Connect your crypto wallet to the Base network

2. Choose the badge collection you want

3. Click 'Mint' if you're eligible

4. Important: Use the same wallet address you used during the campaign, as this proves your eligibility

After minting, you can see your badge by looking up your wallet address on the [Base Blockscout Explorer.](https://base.blockscout.com/)

### Why can't I get a badge?

Each badge is only available to people who participated in specific campaigns during certain time periods. Don't worry though – Blockscout regularly launches new campaigns! Follow our social media to catch the next one.

### Can I trade or sell my badges?

Yes! You can move your badges to different wallets or sell them on NFT marketplaces.

### How many badges can I get?

You can get one badge per campaign you participate in. Collections typically have a limited number of badges available.

### What can I do with my badge?

Right now, your badge shows that you participated in a Blockscout activity. In the future, badges might give you special access to:

* Events

* Exclusive merchandise

* Other special benefits
