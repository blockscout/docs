Streaks provide an opportunity to earn additional Merits by visiting and claiming each day.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
To maintain a streak, you must make a claim within **24 hours of your previous daily claim.** For example, if you make a claim on day 1 at 15:00 UTC, you must make a claim on day 2 by 15:00 UTC to maintain your streak. If you wait until 15:01 UTC, your streak will reset to 0.
{% endhint %}

* Merits must be claimed once per day to maintain a streak. Every day you make a Merits claim, your streak increases by 1.&#x20;
* If you fail to make a claim within 24 hours of your previous claim, your streak resets to 0.&#x20;
* Every 7 days of a streak results in an increased Merit reward. This is a single day award which can is claimed each 7th day of your streak (7,14,21,28 etc).&#x20;
* Currently, the highest reward is 20 Merits, for a total of 30 Merits (10 daily claim Merits + 20 streak reward Merits) available to claim on streak reward days.
