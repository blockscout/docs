## Swapscout Features

- **Simple interface for swapping and bridging**. Swapscout is a convenient, easy-to-use tool for your token management and exchange needs. The clean, straightforward interface is designed for fast and intuitive token exchanges.
- **Flexibility with tokens, chains, and addresses**. Swapscout currently supports operations on 18 blockchains including**Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, Scroll, zkSync, Optimism, Gnosis, Fuse, Lisk, Unichain, Aurora, Immutable, Soneium, Rootstock, Celo, World Chain, and Ink.**  \
  \
  Swap and bridge operations can be initiated by 1 address and sent to the same address or a different address if desired. If the address receiving a token does not have enough gas tokens to cover fees, a portion of the swap can be converted to automatically cover gas costs.
- **Low integrator fees**. Swapscout offers low fees (.4%) on swaps. For example, a \$100 swap incurs a \$0.40 fee.
- **Aggregator fetches the best prices**: The application checks across 32 exchanges and 19 bridges to find the best swap and bridge prices, along with options for different routes if you want faster bridging or prefer to use a specific app or bridge.
- **Li.Fi for consistency and security:** Swapscout uses Li.Fi under the hood to provide swap and bridging functionality. This audited codebase is used throughout the ecosystem and trusted by many projects to provide safe and secure transfers.
