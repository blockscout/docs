An explorer acts as a comprehensive frontend to the blockchain backend. It indexes, fetches, and organizes onchain data along with relevant metadata regarding transactions, blocks, tokens and addresses. Explorers provide all of this information in an organised, human readable format.

Included in the data that explorers provide is smart contract information, the code and methods as well as ways to interaction capabilities. Contract transparency and interaction is only available once a contract is verified.

Direct access to blockchain data is available via the explorer UI as well as through various API endpoints. Blockscout provides both JSON RPC and REST APIs for projects who need direct access to data via API calls.
