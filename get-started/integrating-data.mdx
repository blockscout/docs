Blockscout features integration points for different applications.

## APIs

- [JSON-RPC API ](/devs/apis/rpc) calls that align with the Ethereum [JSON-RPC specifications](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/)
- [REST API](/devs/apis/rest) provides an intuitive interface for all explorer information
- [Additional microservice APIs](https://blockscout.github.io/swaggers/) includes items like the Blockscout name service, Merits, Contract Verifier and others.

## SDK

- The [Blockscout SDK](/devs/blockscout-sdk) provides access to simple explorer-based notifications directly into an application.

## MCP

- The [MCP Server](/devs/mcp-server) wraps Blockscout APIs and exposes blockchain data—balances, tokens, NFTs, contract metadata—via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) so that AI agents and tools (like Claude, Cursor, or IDEs) can access and analyze it contextually.

## Chainscout

- The [Chainscout list](/devs/chainscout-chains-list) provides a list of all known projects using Blockscout along with chain IDs and other relevant information.
