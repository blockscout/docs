## Switching Links

Change links in your application to point to Blockscout

- **Update primary links**. Update all code within an application by replacing the front part of the url. [ <Icon icon="flag" /> Link Switch Guide](/devs/replace-links)
- **Update wallet links**: Many wallets can be updated manually to switch the primary explorer link to Blockscout. [ <Icon icon="wallet" /> Wallet Update Guide](https://www.blog.blockscout.com/changing-wallet-block-explorer-urls-to-blockscout/)
- **Link conversions**: Some Blockscout links are not 1-to-1 with Etherscan, mostly for newer features such as blobs and user ops. Expand to see the full link conversion table, and scroll horizontally to view all link information.

## API updates

No API key is required for Blockscout, but you can use our [free API key](/using-blockscout/my-account/api-keys) to access higher limits if needed. If you have higher or custom needs, [contact us to discuss individual situations.](https://discord.gg/blockscout)

- **JSON RPC**

  JSON RPC calls follow the same query structure as Etherscan. Blockscout supports most of the same calls. Replace the front part of the url from [https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api?chainid=](https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api?chainid=10)X to **https://your-explorer-instance/api**
  - [Docs](/devs/apis/rpc)

  ### **9. Gas Tracking**

  **Etherscan Gas Tracker** (`module=gastracker`)

</Accordion>

- **REST API** availability/swagger

  Blockscout also provides a RESTful API which serves it’s frontend and is available for developers to use.
  - [Documentation and playground](/devs/apis/rest)
  - [Microservice and related swagger definitions](https://blockscout.github.io/swaggers/)
- A **GraphQL** playground is built into the explorer. Explore queries and schemas from the interface by visiting [**https://your-instance-here/graphiql**](https://your-instance-here/graphiql)

## Contract verification process

Blockscout offers advanced contract verification and interaction possibilities. Pre-existing contracts in various contexts are verified automatically (partial verification - which exposes the contract and methods) via the [Ethereum bytecode DB.](/about/features/ethereum-bytecode-database-microservice) New contracts (Solidity, Vyper, Yul) can be verified via dev tools or directly in the Blockscout UI. <Icon icon="paper-plane-top" /> [Contract verification guide](/devs/verification/blockscout-smart-contract-verification-api)

<Check>
  Dev tools widely support the Blockscout explorer. For example:

  - Ethers.js: https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/thirdparty/#providers-blockscout
  - Hardhat: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ericxstone/hardhat-blockscout-verify
  - Foundry: https://docs.blockscout.com/devs/verification/foundry-verification
  - Remix: https://www.blog.blockscout.com/deploy-and-verify-your-contract-using-remix-and-blockscout/

## My Account

Blockscout My Account lets you create watchlists, customize your explorer with private tags, create free API keys for extended use and more. [ <Icon icon="people-pants" /> My Account Guide](/using-blockscout/my-account)

# Making the most of your explorer experience

## Switching from Etherscan

If you are used to using Etherscan, it is easy to switch to Blockscout. Most information is presented in a similar manner and in similar places in the UI with parity in data presentation.
