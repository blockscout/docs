<Tip>
  Blockscout also provides several hosting options for projects who do not want to run their own explorers.

  - [Autoscout](/using-blockscout/autoscout) allows you to setup an explorer in minutes. Hosted on Blockscout's cloud infra.
  - [Explorer as a Service](https://eaas.blockscout.com/) provides an SLA, optimized on prem hosting, and explorer customization.
</Tip>

Blockscout open-source software can be forked and used by any project to quickly setup an full-featured explorer environment. Be sure to [check the requirements](/setup/requirements) and tune your environment before deploying an explorer.
