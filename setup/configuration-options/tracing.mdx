title: "Tracing"
---

BlockScout supports tracing via [Spandex](https://github.com/spandex-project/spandex). Each application has its own internally configured tracer.

To enable tracing, visit each application's `config/<env>.ex` and change `disabled?: true` to `disabled?: false`. Do this for each application you'd like included in your trace data.

Currently, only [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is supported as a tracing backend, but more will be added soon.

## DataDog

If you would like to use DataDog, after enabling `Spandex`, set `"DATADOG_HOST"` and `"DATADOG_PORT"` environment variables to the host/port that your Datadog agent is running on. For more information on Datadog and the Datadog agent, see the [documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/).

## Other

If you want to use a different backend, remove the `SpandexDatadog.ApiServer` `Supervisor.child_spec` from `Explorer.Application` and follow any instructions provided in `Spandex` for setting up that backend.
