<Tip>
ðŸš— [Autoscout is now available](/using-blockscout/autoscout), providing a simple one-click explorer deployment with Blockscout's optimized hosting infrastructure. Use it for early testing, modifications, and launching a full production-grade explorer. [**Get Started Now**](/using-blockscout/autoscout) **and have your explorer up-and-running in minutes.**

</Tip>

Many configurations are handled via [ENV variables](/setup/env-variables). For other options, see the submenu items in this section.
