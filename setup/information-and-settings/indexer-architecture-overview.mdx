## Presentation Highlights

The following presentation describes the past, present and future iterations of Blockscout along with details about how block imports work both synchronously and asynchronously, and a description of the regular and on-demand fetchers.

## Blockscout indexers

See the pdf ⬆️ for more details about the Blockscout indexer. The indexing architecture includes all of the following indexers and fetchers

### Primary Indexers

Both indexers utilize synchronous and asynchronous operations.

- Realtime: Imports new block data from the head of the chain.
- Catchup: Imports data down the chain (starting from the head and moving backwards towards the genesis block)

### Secondary fetchers

### Regular

- Internal transactions
- Pending transactions
- Dropped/Replaced transactions
- Contract bytecodes
- Block rewards
- Token catalog
- Token/coin balances
- NFT instances
- Uncles

### On Demand

- Coin/token balances update
- Contract bytecodes fetch/re-check
- Contract source codes lookup
- NFT instance metadata re-fetch
- Token total supply

### Off-chain integrations

- Coin / token price, market cap, tvl sources: CMC, Coingecko, Cryptorank, Defillama
- Smart contract verification: ETH bytecode DB, Sourcify
- Data enrichment: ENS names, public tags, AI interpreters (own, Noves Fi), sc security scanners (Solidityscan), assets portfolio (Zerion)
- Chain initialization data import: pre-mined coins, precompiled smart-contracts

### Chain-specific fetchers

- There are more than a dozen of chain-specific data fetchers to account for chain differences including arbitrum, optimism, polygon edge, polygon zkevm, zksync etc.

### Temporary fetchers

- Used once to resolve possible data inconsistencies.
