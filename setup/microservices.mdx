<Tip>
ðŸš— [Autoscout is now available](/using-blockscout/autoscout), providing a simple one-click explorer deployment with Blockscout's optimized hosting infrastructure. Use it for early testing, modifications, and launching a full production-grade explorer. [**Get Started Now**](/using-blockscout/autoscout) **and have your explorer up-and-running in minutes.**

</Tip>

Blockscout microservices are individual components written in Rust designed to provide full functionality to the explorer. This architecture allows for better scalability, easier maintenance, and more flexible deployment options.

Information about Blockscout microservices and how to run them is available here:
