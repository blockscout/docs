Terraform config files are currently available for Polygon supernets deployment. Settings can be updated based on client infrastructure.

Examples include deployment for a new Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) instance and deployment within an existing VPC, where ec2 instances, database, security groups and load balancers are added to existing infrastructure.
