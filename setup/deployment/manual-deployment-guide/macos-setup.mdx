<Tip>
ðŸš— [Autoscout is now available](/using-blockscout/autoscout), providing a simple one-click explorer deployment with Blockscout's optimized hosting infrastructure. Use it for early testing, modifications, and launching a full production-grade explorer. [**Get Started Now**](/using-blockscout/autoscout) **and have your explorer up-and-running in minutes.**

</Tip>

<Info>
These instructions use homebrew for setup. [Install homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) if you don't already have it installed.

</Info>

### 1. Install Requirements

Use homebrew to install basic prerequisites (not including Erlang/Elixir/Node which are installed via asdf)

```sh
brew update
brew install node
brew install nvm
brew install automake
brew install libtool
brew install gcc
brew install gmp
```

### 2. Install asdf

[asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/manage/plugins.html) is the easiest way to install and set versioning for Erlang and Elixir.

```sh
brew install asdf
asdf plugin add erlang
asdf plugin add elixir
asdf plugin add nodejs
```

### 3. Install and start PostgreSQL-14

```sh
brew install postgresql@14
brew services start postgresql@14
```

### 4. Clone the Blockscout repository and install .tool-version from the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout blockscout-backend
cd blockscout-backend
asdf install
```

Check your elixir version (`elixir -v`) and node version (`node -v`). You should have the following installed:

* `Elixir 1.15.x (compiled with Erlang/OTP 26)`
* `Node v18.17.1`

If there is no response or the proper version is not showing up, you may need to reshim asdf. Please check the [asdf docs](https://asdf-vm.com/) for further info if this doesn't work.

```bash
asdf reshim  
export PATH=~/.asdf/shims:$PATH
```

Once complete, recheck your versions and proceed with deployment.

<Tip>
**ðŸŽ‰ You are ready for manual deployment! **[**Proceed to step 3 in the "Prepare the Backend section**](/setup/deployment/manual-deployment-guide#1.-prepare-the-backend)**"**
