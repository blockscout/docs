If you would like to customize the theme, follow these steps after a successful deployment:

1. ssh in and stop the BlockScout service:<br/>`sudo systemctl stop blockscout.service`
2. Navigate to `blockscout/apps/block_scout_web/assets/css/theme`.
3. Edit `_poa_variables.scss` with appropriate theme colors.
4. Rebuild the static assets: `sudo npm run-script deploy` (from blockscout/apps/block\_scout\_web/assets directory).
5. Restart the BlockScout service:<br/>`sudo systemctl start blockscout.service`

The BlockScout application will now be running with the designated theme changes.
