## Installation Prerequisites:

#### Required:

1. **Valid email address:** You will receive a temporary password used to access your instance.
2. **Amazon EC2 Public Key (InstanceKey)**. You must create or upload a key pair to your AWS account. [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)
3. **ARNCertificate:** You must create or import an ssl certificate to the AWS Certificate Manager service. **This requires a registered domain name** you can access.
   * How to create a certificate: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html)
   * How to import an existing certificate: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html)
4. **Access to a full archive node running a blockchain with an EVM client**. The node will be connected during installation using the EthereumJsonRPC parameters. BlockScout currently supports [Geth](https://ethereum.gitbooks.io/frontier-guide/getting_a_client.html), [Parity](https://wiki.parity.io/Setup), [RSK](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/wiki/Install-RskJ-and-join-the-RSK-Wasabi-Mainnet) and [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/quickstart).
   * [Example Instructions on creating a local node are available here.](/setup/deployment/ansible-deployment/aws-marketplace/aws-ec2-archive-node-setup)

#### Optional: Route traffic following deployment:

If you leave the `CognitoCallbackDomain` parameter blank during installation and want to use your own domain later, you will need to route traffic to the LoadBalancer and change the Cognito App client settings.

A) Re-route your DNS

* Example instruction to route traffic using Route 53: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-elb-load-balancer.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-elb-load-balancer.html)

B) Configure Cognito settings

* Change the callback URL(s) in client settings. [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-app-settings.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-app-settings.html)

## AWS Installation:

See [Install from AWS Marketplace](/setup/deployment/ansible-deployment/aws-marketplace/install-from-aws-marketplace) for an installation walkthrough.

## Installation Parameters:

Most parameters can be left as default during installation. For a full list of variables see the [ENV variables list](/setup/env-variables).

<Info>
During configuration, the first item to input is **Stack Name.** This is an identifier that helps you find a particular stack from a list of stacks. It must start with an alphabetic character and can't be longer than 128 characters.

</Info>

The following parameters require a user-input value.

| Parameter               | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| DBPassword              | Add a secure password here for database access. Must contain only letters and numbers, and be 8 characters or more. **Record this password for later access**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| EthereumJsonRPCHttpURL  | This is the node url used to fetch blocks, transactions, receipts & tokens. See the instructions on setting up a node on AWS for more information. If setup through AWS, you can find the address in EC2 Dashboard -> Instances -> click to corresponding archive node instance. You will retrieve the ip address and add the port number afterwards. The port for Nethermind is 8545. Example: `http://node.ip.address:8545` |
| EthereumJsonRPCTraceURL | Input the same value as above. This is used to fetch internal transactions and block traces. Example: `http://node.ip.address:8545`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| EthereumJsonRPCWsURL    | The Network RPC endpoint in websocket mode. The default Nethermind port is 8545. Example: `ws://localhost:8545`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| GraphiQLTransaction     | Any transaction from the chain can be used. This hash provides a sample query in the GraphIQL Playground and always begins with “0x…” Example: `0x9415741aa80cacb3e2a9f48506010a3f31fddc7e7a00421381b4e4679d5eba20`                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| IngressIPRangeLB        | IP address range for access to your LoadBalancer instance. Recommend using `0.0.0.0/0` for access from all IPs, or specify your local IP with `your.ip/32`. You can find your ip here: [https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1696588](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1696588)                                                                                                                             |
| InstanceKey             | From step 2 above. The instance key name is located at EC2 Dashboard -> Network & Security -> Key Pairs. It should be available as a dropdown in the template.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| SecretKeybase           | Secret key for production assets protection in base64. You can generate this on the command line of your local machine using the following command: "openssl rand -base64 16" Example: `d29vbmcyY2hhaUNvaG5nCg==`                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
