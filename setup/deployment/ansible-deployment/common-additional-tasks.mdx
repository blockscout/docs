## Cleaning Deployment cache

Despite the fact that the Terraform cache is automatically cleared before each deployment, you may also want to manually force the cleaning process. To clear the Terraform cache, Run the `ansible-playbook clean.yml` command.

## Migrating deployer to another machine

You can easily manipulate your deployment from any machine with sufficient prerequisites. If the `upload_debug_info_to_s3` variable is set to true, the deployer will automatically upload your `all.yml` file to the s3 bucket, so you can download it to any other machine. Simply download this file to your `group_vars` folder and your new deployer will pick up the current deployment instead of creating a new one.

## Attaching the existing RDS instance to the current deployment

Rather than create a new database, you may want to add an existing instance to use with the deployment. To do this, configure all proper values at `group_vars/all.yml`, including your DB ID and name, and execute the `ansible-playbook attach_existing_rds.yml` command. This will add the current DB instance into the Terraform-managed resource group. After that run `ansible-playbook deploy_infra.yml` as you normally would.

**Notes**

1. While executing `ansible-playbook attach_existing_rds.yml` the S3 and DynamoDB instances will be automatically created (if `backend` variable is set to `true`) to store Terraform state files.
2. The actual name of your resource must include the prefix you are using with this deployment.<br/>Example:<br/>Real resource: tf-poa<br/>`prefix` variable: tf<br/>`chain_db_id` variable: poa
3. Make sure MultiAZ is disabled on your database.
4. Make sure that all the variables at `group_vars/all.yml` are exactly the same as your existing DB.

## Using AWS CodeDeploy to Monitor and manage a BlockScout deployment

BlockScout deployment can be managed through the AWS console. [A brief tutorial is available on our forum](https://forum.poa.network/t/monitor-and-manage-a-blockscout-deployment-using-codedeploy-in-your-aws-console/2499).
