<Accordion title="Are there any additional tutorials for Blockscout deployment?">
We are currently working on more tutorials from the team. There are some user and community generated videos available here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dH-ZxV1ShQ-cb7gObTXs3MtwSqVNJOqW](<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dH-ZxV1ShQ-cb7gObTXs3MtwSqVNJOqW >)

<Accordion title="Where are the environmental variable (ENV) settings located?">
* Frontend envs: [https://github.com/blockscout/frontend/blob/main/docs/ENVS.md](https://github.com/blockscout/frontend/blob/main/docs/ENVS.md)
* Backend envs: [https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout/blob/master/docker-compose/envs/common-blockscout.env](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout/blob/master/docker-compose/envs/common-blockscout.env)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I connect the frontend to the backend?">
This is done through the [proxy setup](/setup/deployment/frontend-migration/proxy-setup). Ensure you've added the `API_V2_ENABLED='true'` in your blockscout instance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do the frontend and backend need to be under the same domain?">
Yes. Be sure to proxy all /api, /socket requests to the backend application and all other requests to the frontend. More info on the [proxy setup](/setup/deployment/frontend-migration/proxy-setup) page.

<Accordion title="What are the variable settings for a Polygon Edge client?">
Be sure to set the following envs when setting up a Polygon Edge instance:

* `ETHEREUM_JSONRPC_VARIANT=geth`
* `INDEXER_INTERNAL_TRANSACTIONS_TRACER_TYPE=polygon_edge`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Blockscout API/indexer is using 100% CPU, what should I do?">
You should allocate more computing resources/cores to the instance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What should I set the proxy\_pass variable to?">
Typically you should set to [http://youripaddress:your\_port\_number](http://youripaddress:8153/;). Blockscout may not work if you set to [http://0.0.0.0:](http://0.0.0.0:8153/;)your\_port\_number
