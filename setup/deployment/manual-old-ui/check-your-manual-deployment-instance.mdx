title: "Manual Cleaning An Instance From The Previous Deployment"
---

In order to delete build artifacts anyone can run `./rel/commands/clear_build.sh` from the root project directory. It will delete these folders:

* delete `_build` & `deps` directories
* delete node modules located at
* `apps/block_scout_web/assets/node_modules`
* & `apps/explorer/node_modules`
* delete `logs/dev` directory

<Info>
You should also delete static assets (`apps/block_scout_web/priv/static `folder). Before rebuilding to apply changes to the front-end, run the previous command with `-f` flag:

`./rel/commands/clear_build.sh -f`
