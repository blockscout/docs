Customize the UI of your running app instance (for example, homepage appearance, sidebar menu, and links in the footer) or enable certain features (like “My account’, “Marketplace”, “Blockchain interaction”, etc) by passing additional variables to your front-end container. These can be passed during runtime, added to the docker container in the `environment:` list, or changed within the `.env` file.
