title: "Hardware & Hosting Requirements"

Resource requirements may vary based on chain size and other parameters. This mainly impacts [database storage](/setup/requirements/database-storage-requirements) requirements. Basic [prerequisites](/setup/requirements/requirements) and settings can be found throughout the [Information and Settings](/setup/information-and-settings) section for developers.

BlockScout requires a full archive node to import every state change for every address on the target network.

## Recommended Base Hardware

EVM chains can differ in size and requirements, these are the recommendations for optimal performance.

| CPU | 16 core, 32 thread |
| --- | ------------------ |
| RAM | 128GB              |

## Hosting Requirements

Minimums are listed for an AWS Cloud instance and can be inferred to other hosting providers.

<Info>
Requirements will vary based on chain. For example, these are the recommended requirements for a Harmony Explorer Node:

**Setup**: AWS i3en.12xlarge or equivalent, with local disk storage **Storage**: \~24TB (4x NVMe SSD) is recommended for Archival Explorer Nodes on Shard 0 **OS**: Latest Ubuntu Linux (LTS Version) **Network**: 100M+ bandwidth

</Info>

<Tip>
For additional information, see:

* [General Requirements:](/setup/requirements/requirements) Software required for deployment

* [Database Storage Requirements](/setup/requirements/database-storage-requirements): Storage required for common chains to give a sense of needed storage

* [Node Tracing Requirements](/setup/requirements/node-tracing-json-rpc-requirements): JSON RPC methods

* [Client Setting Requirements](/setup/requirements/client-settings): Settings related to client implementations (ie Geth, OpenEthereum, etc)
